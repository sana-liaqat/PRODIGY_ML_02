# Project Description: Customer Segmentation of a retail store using KMeans Clustering by Sana Liaqat

Description: This repository contains the implementation of KMeans Clustering as part of my Machine Learning Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

Objective: This project aims to segment mall customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic attributes using KMeans clustering.

Data Source: The data used in this project is sourced from a CSV file stored on Google Drive, containing information about mall customers, including age, annual income, and spending score.

Methodology: 

1. The data was preprocessed by normalizing numerical features using StandardScaler.
2. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method, revealing 3 distinct clusters.
3. KMeans clustering was applied to group customers into clusters based on their scaled features.

Visualization:

1. Visualizations included scatter plots in 2D and 3D to depict the clusters based on different feature combinations.
2. Box plots were used to visualize and compare cluster profiles for annual income and spending score.

Insights:

1. The analysis identified clear customer segments characterized by their income levels, spending behaviors, and age groups.
Insights gained from the clustering analysis can inform targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer engagement approaches.
Tools and Libraries:
2. Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib were utilized for data manipulation, clustering, and visualization.
Conclusion:
3. By effectively segmenting customers into distinct groups, businesses can tailor marketing campaigns and services to better meet the diverse needs and preferences of different customer segments.
